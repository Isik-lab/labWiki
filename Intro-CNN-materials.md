I find it is helpful to get an intuition about deep CNNs to first read about the HMAX model. This is a small, biologically-inspired CNN, with parameters based on recordings in the primate visual system:

Two useful resources for understanding modern DNNs are this [review article](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature14539) and this [blog post](https://ujjwalkarn.me/2016/08/11/intuitive-explanation-convnets/)

Here is review on using DNNs as a tool in cog neuro:
